## MPII Gaze Dataset – Basic Structure & Preprocessing Guide

📁 Dataset Structure Overview

The dataset is organized like a folder tree. At the top level, everything is divided into different sections based on raw data, processed data, and annotations.

1️⃣ Original Data (Raw Data)

Path example:

`Data → Original → p00 → Day01

p00 → Person ID (participant 00)

Day01 → Data collected on Day 1`

Inside this folder:

👁 Eye Patch Images

👁 Cropped images of the left and right eyes.

These are the main inputs for gaze prediction models.

📝 Annotation

Each eye image has associated metadata:

👁 *Detected eye landmarks*
Points around the eye (corners, eyelids, etc.).

👁 *On-screen gaze target position (2D)*
The exact position on the screen where the person was looking.

👁 *3D gaze target position*
Gaze position in 3D space.

👁 *Estimated 3D head pose*
Direction and rotation of the head.

So basically, for each image you get:

Eye Image + Gaze Location + Head Direction
2️⃣ Calibration Data

This is mainly used if you want precise 3D gaze estimation or screen coordinate mapping.

3️⃣ Normalized Eye Images

4️⃣ 5-Point Based 3D Face Model

A simplified 3D face model using 5 key facial landmarks.

Used for:

👁 Head pose estimation

👁 3D alignment

5️⃣ Evaluation Subset

Contains:

Image list only

Used for:

Testing and benchmarking models
